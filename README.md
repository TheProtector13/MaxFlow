# MaxFlow
Software for visualization of maximum flow algorithms!

The program provides an interface for the user to create flow networks. The prepared graphs can be saved to the disc as files for later use. The saved graphs can be loaded. The software can run maximum flow simulations on the graphs using Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp and Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithms. The user can run the entire simulation at once, or step by step. The user can learn how these algorithms work by using this software, or the user can use the software to calculate maximum flow with illustrations
